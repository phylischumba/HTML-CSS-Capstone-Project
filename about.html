                <h1>Home Schoolers Meetup 2020 Logo</h1>

                    The Home schoolers meetup event was all created during a science contest in January 2019 after organizers realised that homeschooling is left out.<br>
                    Organizers therefore came up with an idea of having a meetup event specifically for homeschooling parents/guardians and the learners for socialization intentions.<br>
                    The lead organiser suggested for the meetup in 2020. During planning and organization for it, they the came up with a logo as follows:</p>
